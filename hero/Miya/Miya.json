    "story": "Miya was born in the Temple of the Moon and studied hard to one day become the next Moon God. When the fires of war between Humans and Orcs engulfed the Moon Elves, the Moon Elf Hero Miya took a stand and led her fellow Moon Elves to resist the invasion. Despite their best efforts, Miya and her fellow elves were forced to make a last stand in the temple against the enemy. Miya knelt in the center of the temple to pray for one last time when all hope was lost.Then, a miracle occurred. The Moon God answered Miya's prayer and blessed her longbow with an ancient power. Miya grasped the newly endowed bow and fired an arrow, and with the power of the stars,turned into an eagle spirit and caused the enemy into chao. Miya led her people out of the temple, raining showers of star-wrought arrows upon the enemy with each pull of her bow. Meanwhile the magical eagle hovered over the enemy, singling them out and attacking them. Like a falling tide, the humans and orcs quickly started to retreat. Miya and her countrymen retook the shores of the Moon God, and the moon elves recognized Miya and her spirit eagle as the Moon God incarnated. The young Miya knew in her heart that if this problem was not stopped at the root, the wars would never end. With the Moon God's blessing, she set out on a journey to the land of dawn, hoping to find a king who could bring peace and order back to this world.",

This skill can help Miya to deal heavy AoE damage in team fights. This skill benefits greatly from physical attack obtained through items, so you should only upgrade it to level 1 in the early game, until you get some gear."

Combine this with other teammates\u2019 control skills to leave your enemy feeling hopeless. This is Miya\u2019s main damage and wave-clearing skill in the early game, and is therefore a priority when upgrading skills."
