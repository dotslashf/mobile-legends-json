    "story": "As the final battle started, the Twilight Orb devoured the energies within the Mage and opened up, allowing a girl who was surrounded by the power of Chaos and Order to step out. Her eyes were as deep as the ancient lake.  The mysterious atmosphere she created then put all of the heroes into a dreamland...... The powers of Chaos and Order have been struggling against each other since ancient times, and the struggle had driven the world into desperation. Lunox, the mysterious maiden, is the one who survived the desperation. With her unique talent, she can project her dream into reality and change it.  One day, a sound whispered to her, and told her to balance the two powers with her dreamland ability. But the cost would be larger than ever. For the world she loves, she accepted this fate, channeled the two powers into dreamland and became one with the \"Twilight Orb\", at the cost of falling into endless sleep. But the sound also told Lunox that one day, she will wake up to proceed to her fate - to find other Twilight Orbs that have been forgotten by history.",
