The Kagura family is the oldest and most powerful of the Onmyouji, with the most powerful of all being the Ancestor Master. Kagura, as one in the Onmyouji family with the most potential, was given the Seimei umbrella, an heirloom of the yin yang arts passed down through generations. Legend has it that the umbrella was refined by the great Seimei himself using power from a hundred ghosts. It is believed that it now possesses life and wisdom of its own which can only be controlled by its rightful owner. After learning that her childhood playmate Hayabusa had departed for the Land of Dawn to undertake a dangerous mission, Kagura secretly took the Seimei umbrella and followed in Hayabusa's step, hoping to help him in battle.",
