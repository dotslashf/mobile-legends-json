    "story": "Chang'e is the youngest disciple of the Great Dragon. She exhibited amazing magical potential from an early age, quickly mastering the Great Dragon's greatest spell \u2014 The Sacred Satellite. From then on, Chang'e earned the eternal love of the Great Dragon. However, Chang'e's energetic and playful personality gave the Great Dragon quite a few headaches so he finally asked Zilong, his adopted son, to look after Chang'e. The Great Dragon was hopeful that Zilong's diligent and determined character could help guide Chang'e. Solemn as Zilong was, he came to love the lively and intelligent Chang'e as his little sister. They often spent countless hours together practicing magic. Zilong even managed to find the Moon Rabbit as a gift for Chang'e. Zilong was hoping that one day Chang'e would discover the strength of the divine rabbit and with its help improve her magic ability. Chang'e read Zilong's mind and took good care of the Moon Rabbit, accompanying it every day. During the second War of the Planes, Zilong assisted the wise rulers of the land, traveling between worlds. After he left, Chang'e returned to her naughty and childish ways, even the Moon Rabbit did something naughty from time to time. At one point, the Great Dragon was not sure if there would ever be another day of peace\u2014That is, until the Moon Rabbit accidentally swallowed one of his sacred pills, thinking it was candy. The Great Dragon immediately cast the Moon Rabbit out of his sanctuary. To everyone's surprise, the Moon Rabbit rebelled again the Great Dragon. At the very moment of the Great Dragon taking its life, Chang'e saved the Rabbit and decided to assist Zilong and make up for her mistake together with the Moon Rabbit. Even then, the Great Dragon felt compelled to give Chang'e his precious Crescent Moon to protect her.",
