Cute, friendly and uninvolved in the conflicts of the world, they are the loyal preservers of the Enchanted Forest who make the area the fairyland paradise that it is. As the most ancient race of the Enchanted Forest, they possess a strong natural talent for all things magical.Nana is special among the Leonins. With a bright personality and love of adventure, she is full of curiosity for all things new and hopes to one day leave her home and see the world.But Nana also has a mischievous side that often causes trouble for those around her. She is naturally gifted with strong magical abilities, but doesn't know how to control them. The most serious time she lost control of her impressive abilities resulted in the destruction of almost half the forest. In order to protect the Leonins from her uncontrollable magic abilities, Nana decided to leave her home. In her travels she met a Moon Elf named Miya who suppressed Nana's magic abilities and then taught her the Moon Elves\u2019 secret to control magical energies. The intelligent Nana quickly mastered the technique and became a powerful witch of the Leonin clan. She chose to follow Miya to the Land of Dawn in search for the new King.",
