Belerick's heart is filled with nothing but kindness\u2014He absolutely hates conflict. Within his ancient self, Belerick possesses a strong life force that provides strong resistance against attacks and also allows him to reincarnate. Due to his kind nature, wherever there is conflict, Belerick will be there to help the righteous and weak. One day, Belerick believed he heard the words of the ancient ones guiding him towards the desert. However, he was met with disaster. The great Minoan empire was left in ruins and Minotaur people were filled with despair. In order to save what was left of the Minoans, Belerick unleashed all of his life force to create a beautiful oasis. The Minoan people were filled with hope once more. Seeing this, Belerick's heart was at peace and fell into a deep slumber. Although Belerick can not pursue the task the Ancient Ones bestowed upon him, he felt no regret\u2014There's nothing more important than life after all.",
