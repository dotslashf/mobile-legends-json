    "story": "Chungmugong Yi Sun-shin was a famous general in an Asian kingdom. He was extremely loyal and brave. At a time when the nation was in danger, Yi Sun-shin built a powerful navy and created the iron armored 'turtle ship'. This made an indelible contribution to the Korean Kingdom which became known for dominating the sea areas. 'Wherever iron turtle ship sails, the sea areas belong to me.' said Yi. Yi was excellent at the strategy of 'overtaking the majority with the minority'. Under his leadership, the Korean navy defeated over 330 enemy warships with only 12 ships, gaining a great triumph at the Battle of Myeongnyang. To this day, the legend of this Asian general still lives on in the hearts of people.",
