    "story": "No one knows where he comes from or why he fights, but everyone born in the Wastelands knows that Clint is the only semblance of justice in these parts. Even the boldest of thieves wouldn't dare to challenge Clint and his six shooters. With his lightning reflexes and unparalleled accuracy, he buries a flurry of bullets into his enemies' foreheads before they have time to blink. He only draws his guns for what he believes are just causes, but when he does, there's hardly a villain alive who can escape his righteous barrels.",
