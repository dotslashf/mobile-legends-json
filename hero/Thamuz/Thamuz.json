He was an excellent warrior, with a fierce temper, unabashed to use cruel methods in achieving his goals. Possessing ungodly natural strength, Thamuz was appointed chief of the abyss, who led the abyss to conquer all of the underworld. To Thamuz, all of his opponents were worthless scum, unworthy of living in this world. In his eyes, only he was worthy to lead. Thamuz could not accept the Blood Demon, Alice, as her bloodline was not pure \u2014 thus, unworthy to command and enter war.With the gates to the Abyss about to open, legions of demons eagerly await Thamuz's return. However, once the King of Fire Demons returns he will burn away all the weak demons\u2014Only the strong deserve to be a part of the Abyssal Army.
