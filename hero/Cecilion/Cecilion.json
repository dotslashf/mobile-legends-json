She loved Cecilion for who he is. After putting on the white wedding dress,  Carmilla cut her wrist with a sharp dagger, forfeiting her life for he love for Cecilion.Giving up Carmilla made Cecilion feel terribly sad, and his life seemed to return to what it had been. After two lonely nights, Cecilion went to see Carmilla, from a distance.But when Cecilion arrived, he found Carmilla's cold corpse lying still at a solemn funeral. For a moment Cecilion felt nothing but pain and regret. How could he live as a human being without Carmilla?
