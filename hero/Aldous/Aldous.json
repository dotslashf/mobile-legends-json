Some say that there is a group of mercenaries who guard the entire maze. ??The Kingdom produced a lot of precious jade, which brought the Minoan people great wealth.

To gather this strange energy, Selena brought her Abyssal Demons with her to the entrance of the Minoan Maze \u2014 A huge battle was about to begin.",
