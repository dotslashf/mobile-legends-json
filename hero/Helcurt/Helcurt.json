Their bodies were transformed using dark magic, granting them the ability to swallow light and travel through space in the blink of an eye, allowing them to surprise their enemies with deadly sneak attacks. What was most terrifying about them, however, was the concoction of natural poisons emitted from their tails, for those unfortunate enough to come into contact with this poison would soon be saying their last words. However, this is what caused the ultimate demise of this race. In the annals, the specifics of how this race were wiped out are not made clear, but it is certain that this terrifying race definitely walked upon on the Land of Dawn. Since their extinction, humanity had progressed prosperously, however, the history books could not predict that one day these creatures would slowly creep out of the shadows once more...",

            "tips": "Use it anytime anywhere to make all enemy heroes lose vision by 3.5s (except Helcurt). A very useful skill. The bonus movement speed allows him to go to the fight quickly or chase an enemy. The bonus attack speed substantially increases his burst damage. Let the enemies fear the invisibility. P.S: It's not effective on enemy Helcurt."
