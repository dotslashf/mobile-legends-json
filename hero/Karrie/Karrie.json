    "story": "Alaghat is a mysterious technique empire. There lives a strange humanoid race - Yasson. They are in human form while having a pair of deformed feet. They are agile and born to fight. They are also good at techniques that allow them to create a significant civilization and to invade others. Since Karrie was a child, she was very talented and trained into an excellent and arrogant warrior leader. But at the same time, she lost her feelings and became a machine. During one battle, she was overconfident and got seriously injured. But a prophet from another race saved her and injected his consciousness into her brain. Since then there has been a voice in her head; the prophet told her that the ruin of her empire is about to come and there will be no Yasson anymore. After her escape from death, Karrie didn't believe the voice in her head. But she started to suspect it was right after returning to her empire. In order to save her empire, and for her own redemption, Karrie chose to believe and came to the Land of Dawn. What kind of destiny is waiting for her?",
