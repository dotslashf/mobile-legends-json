    "story": "On the barren Megalith Wastelands, all one can see are the giant rocks and the sparse bushes, but this desolate land is where Hilda and her people call home. The land's infertile soil required everyone in the clan to become a good hunter in order to acquire precious meat. Born with great strength, Hilda soon became the leader of the hunting party and led her people to harvest great amounts of food. However, an unknown power in their territory drove wild animals into a frenzy and it became more and more difficult to hunt. Eventually, crazy beasts started to attack the clan. As the patriarch's premonition of a crisis started to become a reality, Hilda was forced to search for new habitats. With the hopes and dreams of the tribe on her back, she headed to the Land of Dawn. With her rich hunting experience, she became a mercenary of great reputation and expertise. Her only wish is to find a new home for her people and to fight for their future.",
